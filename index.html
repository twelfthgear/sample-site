            Here at SampleSite™ we believe that you deserve to know what you're choosing before you choose it.  
        </h3>
        <p>
            Have you ever purchased a frozen meal that looked better on the box than after you opened it?  Have you ever wished you could find out which of the millions of warm soups available <em>actually</em> taste good?  
        </p>
        <p>
            Now there's a better way: a way that allows (and even <em>encourages</em>) you to be indecisive.  
        </p>
        <p>
            When you sign up for SampleSite™ you get fresh samples of the foods you want delivered right to your door.  Conveniently-sized as partial-servings, you can choose to try five different salads, five types of trail mix, or even five brands of chili.  But you won't have to pay for full packages.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Our food packs are vacuum-sealed and chilled to stay fresh up to 127 hours.  That's long enough to go on a hiking trip!  So sign up now and try … everything.
